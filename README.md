# Network-Threat-Detection-and-Prevention-with-Suricata-and-Wazuh

This project documents the design, setup, and testing of a network-based threat detection and prevention lab using Suricata IDS/IPS, Wazuh SIEM. The objective is to simulate real-world threats and verify the detection and prevention mechanism

## Project Overview
The goal of this lab is to build a modular network security environment, where:

- Suricata monitors and blocks malicious traffic at the network layer (IDS/IPS)
- Wazuh aggregates logs and detects incidents

The lab replicates SOC-level visibility and allows testing against simulated attacks from Kali Linux.

## üîç Project Goals  

- Deploy Suricata as an IPS gateway
- Route all DMZ traffic through Suricata
- Enable Suricata log forwarding to Wazuh
- Create custom Suricata rules (detection + blocking)
- Test existing rules and custom rules using Kali Linux

## üß© Key Steps

### 1. Lab VM Setup
- 3 Virtual Machines:
  - Suricata Gateway
  - Web Server ([Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) on Debian 12)
  - Vulnerable Host ([Metasploitable 2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/))
- 1 Kali Linux VM for attack simulation
- 1 Wazuh server (already set up [here](https://github.com/Apelsyn582/Wazuh-SIEM-Home-Lab-Detection-of-Suspicious-Activities/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#wazuh-siem-home-lab--detection-and-prevention-of-suspicious-activities))

### 2. IPTables and Network Routing
- Debian Suricata machine set up as gateway with 2 NICs:
  - enp0s3 ‚Äî WAN (LAN side)
  - enp0s8 ‚Äî DMZ interface
- Configured IP forwarding and NAT
- Configured iptables to forward DMZ traffic

### 3. Suricata Installation and Integration in Wazuh

##### Wazuh was installed and configured in [this](https://github.com/Apelsyn582/Wazuh-SIEM-Home-Lab-Detection-of-Suspicious-Activities/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#wazuh-siem-home-lab--detection-and-prevention-of-suspicious-activities) lab
- Installed and configured Suricata
- Installed Wazuh agent on Suricata Gateway
- Create two custom rules to prevent Syn Scan Technique and Brute-force attack against Web app
üìÑ[All this steps you can check here](Suricata Installation and Integration with Wazuh.pdf)


### 6. Attack Simulation - Rules Testing with Kali
Ran:
- Nmap scans
- Nikto/Dirb
- SQLMap
- Metasploit module or exploit
- Verified detections in:
- Suricata logs
- Wazuh dashboard



### 7. Analysis & Conclusion
-Attack vector vs detection correlation
-Prevention efficiency of Suricata vs WAF
-Wazuh's role in visibility & triage
-Possible next steps (add Honeypots, ELK, etc.)
